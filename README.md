# Datasets for the ICPE 2024 Data Challenge track

Information about the track:
[https://icpe2024.spec.org/tracks-and-submissions/data-challenge-track](https://icpe2024.spec.org/tracks-and-submissions/data-challenge-track/)

The dataset is composed by 560 csv files that are pre-processed execution traces from two  microservices systems, namely [E-Shopper](https://github.com/SEALABQualityGroup/E-Shopper) and [Train-Ticket](https://github.com/FudanSELab/train-ticket).

The pre-processed traces are organized as tabular data available in the [data](data) folder. 
Each csv file refers to a specific scenario that involves particular performance anomalies that affect one or multiple Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs).
Each row of the csv file refers to a specific end-to-end request within the microservices system.
Each column reports the cumulative response time (in milliseconds) of particular RPC within the end-to-end request. It is cumulative because if the same RPC is invoked multiple times within a request, the response time of each invocation is summed up.
The `Latency` column reports the end-to-end response time of each request, i.e., the response time of the root RPC.
An additional column (`anomaly`) specifies whether the request is affected by a performance issue or not. `0` indicates no anomalies in the request, while values â‰¥ `1` indicates the presence of a  performance issue.
Each scenario involves two different types of performance issue (namely, `1` and `2`).
Each type of performance issue affect a distict set of RPCs.
For a detailed exaplanation of the dataset generation process refers to Section X of [(Traini and Cortellessa, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2023.3266041).
The csv files reported in the [data](data) folder refers to the data used in the context of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3.

## Usage example

The Jupyter notebooks [Example-Supervised.ipynb](Example-Supervised.ipynb) and [Example-Unsupervised.ipynb](Example-Supervised.ipynb) report explanatory examples of dataset usage, involving the adoption of unsupervised and supervised machine learning models, respectively. The notebooks execution requires `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn` and `notebook`:
```
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The dataset was originally created for the paper:

L. Traini and V. Cortellessa, ***DeLag: Using Multi-Objective Optimization to Enhance the Detection of Latency Degradation Patterns in Service-Based Systems***, in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, vol. 49, no. 6, pp. 3554-3580, 1 June 2023, [DOI: 10.1109/TSE.2023.3266041](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2023.3266041).
